hey so uh this is mostly a website i made when i was bored during my classes for fun the moment we'd get to learn how to make websites using notepad or notepad++. keep in mind that i made this website for fun and uh i don't really have enough coding experience so yeah. i thought it'd be kinda funny to leave this as a public website for everyone to see. i've always wanted to, and i've always had other plans for this silly little website so there's that. idk how to end stuff so enjoy the website i guess
